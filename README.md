# Pillow-Tesseract-and-OpenCV
This project make use of three of the most popular image processing and machine learning libraries
- Pillow (image manupulation library)
- Tesseract (optical character recognisation)
- OpenCv (face detection library)
In this project,a zip file named -> 'small_img.zip' contains some images of a newspaper columns.
These newspapers are in english, and contain a variety of stories, advertisements and images.
The task is to write python code which allows one to search through the images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces. 
E.g. if you search for "pizza" it will return a contact sheet of all of the faces which were located on the newspaper page which mentions "pizza".

#### pdf file 'project_output3.pdf' with the code and output is given for the overview of the project.
#### A Jupyter Notebook named 'pillow,tessaract and OpenCV.ipynb' contains the actual code.
